# NeuroAI-project-Biologically-Plausible-Learning-rules
For the 2024 Neuromatch NeuroAI project. We explored how well more biologically plausible algorithms such as Feedback alignment, Hebbian learning, weight and node pertubation ,kolen Pollack perform against backpropagation in digit identification task using MNIST dataset
